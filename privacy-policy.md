## Access and Permission

### Camera permission
The permission to access camera is used to scan QR codes in order to provide an easy method for entering device IDs. The app does not save any pictures or video in the process. The app will still work if the user denies the permission and enters the device ID manually.


## Information Collection and Use
**The developer of the Syncthing-Lite doesn't have access to or gather any form of data from users of the application.** "data" for example refers to personal data, configuration files, unique IDs, files synchronized by Syncthing. The public servers offered by the Syncthing Community such as discovery and relay servers may gather data from users, for example, encrypted data flowing through them or certificates which represent Syncthing device IDs. Syncthing-Lite depends on those public servers. (This may change with future releases as we plan to support direct IP-to-IP connections as well.)

**To state this clearly:**

**[Syncthing](https://www.syncthing.net) including their discovery and relay server infrastructure is a different project and you should look up their privacy policy at [https://www.syncthing.net](https://www.syncthing.net).**

At the time of writing, it's TLSv1.3 handshake and encryption. If you believe you've found a Syncthing-related security vulnerability, please contact the Syncthing team at [https://syncthing.net/security.html](https://syncthing.net/security.html).
